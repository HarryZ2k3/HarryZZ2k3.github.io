        <p><em>A note for anyone who has the chance to read this. These are my thoughts at different points in time, so they might sound inconsistent. But if you’re reading this, thanks for having an interest in my thoughts, because, who am I to judge?</em></p>

            <h3>#1 The Infinite Universe</h3>
            <p class="date">Date Unknown</p>
            <p>Our universe is made of a smaller universe, and that smaller universe is made of an even smaller one. At the same time, our universe is part of a much bigger one. Each of these universes follows its own laws. For example, the laws of our universe don’t apply in the quantum world.</p>
            <p>I believe that we exist in a finite number of universes, with a "biggest" universe that consists of an infinitely smaller series of universes. If that is true, there must be an infinite number of laws that we could never comprehend outside of our own existence.</p>

            <h3>#2 Why Are High-Grade Vietnamese English Students Bad at Speaking English?</h3>
            <p class="date">Date Unknown</p>
            <p>From my perspective, the reason is the way English is taught in our education system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**One:** Students are taught overly complex sentence structures that only computers can memorize, not humans. When learning your native language, do you start by studying sentence structure? No, you learn through input and correction.</li>
                <li>**Two:** English is treated as a mathematical subject, not a language. Students learn a sentence structure (e.g., passive voice) and then try to use it to create variations of sentences, like applying a mathematical formula. But language doesn’t work like math. Native speakers don’t “apply formulas” in real-time—they just speak naturally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In conclusion, English education should focus more on helping students think like a native speaker rather than memorizing rules.</p>

            <h3>#3 What Are We Actually Learning from School?</h3>
            <p class="date">Date Unknown</p>
            <p>Most of the “knowledge” we learn in school is meant to be forgotten. A wise man once said, “If you try to make sense of everything, you will go insane.”</p>
            <p>So why do we keep learning things we are bound to forget? Why do so many young people suffer from stress and even consider suicide due to school pressure?</p>
            <p>Here’s what I think:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Schools are outdated.** They were originally designed during the industrial revolution to train factory workers. Bells, strict schedules, and rigid disciplines are all remnants of that system.</li>
                <li>**Subjects are outdated.** Many students spend 16 years in school but graduate without basic life skills like paying taxes or cooking. Instead of prioritizing problem-solving and critical thinking, we are forced into repetitive, mind-numbing exercises.</li>
                <li>**Perfection is a myth.** No two humans are the same. Yet, the school system tries to mold students into a standardized "ideal" that doesn’t exist.</li>
                <li>**Vietnam’s education system prioritizes math and literature** over other subjects, leading to an imbalance where students lack real-world social skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Modern schools are killing creativity. We call imagination "the child inside us that survived," yet our education system is erasing it. The world is changing thanks to innovation, but schools refuse to change with it.</p>

            <h3>#4 The Flow of Life</h3>
            <p class="date">Date Unknown</p>
            <p>Here I am, writing about life again. It’s been a long time since I sat down and reflected.</p>
            <p>Maybe I only write when I feel down. A lot has happened lately. My grades aren’t great by my mother’s standards, and I know she won’t be happy about it. The same scolding, the same cycle.</p>
            <p>I try to tell myself that school—especially Vietnamese school—isn’t as important as people make it out to be. But then, doubts creep in. Am I wrong? Nobody knows.</p>
            <p>Recently, I learned more about my father’s past, about the struggles he went through to get here. It was eye-opening. But it also left me with mixed emotions, a lot of thinking.</p>
            <p>There’s a saying in Eastern philosophy: "You can’t fight the current. Flow with it and use it as propulsion to grow." But what if the current leads to a deadly waterfall? What if the very act of flowing pulls you toward destruction?</p>
            <p>And yet, in nature, there are tunas that swim against the strongest currents, climbing waterfalls taller than skyscrapers to find a safe haven. Maybe that’s what life is—an endless struggle to find our place.</p>
            <p>Life is more complicated than I once thought. But I believe there is a way to live a healthy life, both mentally and physically. And I’ve set myself a mission to find it.</p>
